How to interpret fixed effect model

fixed effect model make intercepts 0 which capture heterogeneity in the model. 

Therefore, we can only see the actual effect of each random variable, ignoring any omitted effect in regression .

This means, each coefficient in the result shows the actual effect on Y variable. 

whereas, OLS result shows the result with the channeltype and audience type 

in the case of video complete it is really indirect to make an effect of conversion 

the interesting thing is social share would decrease the conversion. 
we need more theorical background to explain this but 
we can imagine that social share is sensitive to who shared this. 
if warren bufit shared the certain financial thing then this result would be great
if I shared a post then we cannot calculate the result. 
and when we look into data shares occur in a specific type of audience and channel
in the fixed effect model this value decrease very much 
which means that the actual effect is not that much large as -3. 




how to defense HOW CTR works as control variable?
because we can assume that CTR is not independent with 3 variables.

this is great question yes, we can think the three variables are parallel with CTR
however, the context is expecting effect of three variables to future conversion 

three variables could be came from the past CTR but it does not related with future conversion. 
we used the average CTR of each day not following the audience type and ad channel type
so we can say this is independent with three variables.
